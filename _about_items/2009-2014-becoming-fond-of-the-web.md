The web has always fascinated me. I realised that my very early attempts to build websites including client-side VBScript weren't exactly future-proof.

So I started reading. Reading about new HTML specifications, Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript best practices. Reading about all the browser vendors doing their own thing.

Soon I was using the alpha versions of Opera (later Chrome) to get all the exciting new features of HTML5 and CSS3. Web components, web sockets, shared workers — just to name a few — are representing what the web is today: an exciting software development environment to work in.

It all comes with a price. You must be willing to learn something new every day. But if learning something new is just your thing, go for it! That's why I love it.
