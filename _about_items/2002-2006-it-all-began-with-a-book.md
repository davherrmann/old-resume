...standing in my father's bookshelf. Not any book, but 1260 pages [full of Visual Basic 6][vb6kompendium]. I basically took it and started reading — at the age of 11. Reading about things I had never heard of before. And putting those things into practice (copying code from the book). What a delight it was to see my own currency converter running under Windows XP!

I have always admired my father for being an electronics engineer creating blinking lights, programming robots and doing a lot of cool stuff. I am very thankful for everything he taught me.

Back then I loved Visual Basic 6. Not for the syntax, not for the style, not for the performance. I loved it for the whole new world I could discover. Creating my own small projects — games, tools and other programs — taught me many invaluable lessons: despite all questions [don't give up][equals], [don't give up][syntaxerror], [don't give up][trigonometry].
