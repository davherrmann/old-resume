I am pretty certain that there are some JavaScript frameworks which were abandoned before I ever knew of their existence. Quite honestly, I am not sad. They obviously didn't meet the needs of the market. The need for quality, for modularity, for clarity, for separation of concerns â€” the need for high quality web applications.

Though it can be challenging not to be overwhelmed by [the wave of new javascript frameworks][jsframeworks], I am excited to see new concepts and best practices come up. It's a sign of progress.

It really helped me to use the latest technologies in several projects. But even if don't have the time to stay up to date with the latest frameworks you can do one thing: You can adopt the spirit. Challenge yourself! Don't take things for granted. Ask yourself: Can we do things better?
