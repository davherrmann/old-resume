Due to my activities as a voluntary fire fighter I got the opportunity to automate [the building of our voluntary fire brigade.][firebrigade] I threw in some Arduinos, a Raspberry Pi, a lot of sensors and actors, glued it with wires and a parallel processing python engine and got out a fully automated building.

You want to open the garage doors remotely with your smartphone? Or grant access to the building for certain persons at certain points of time using their RFID chip? Maybe you wish to turn on all lights and open the doors automatically in the case of an alarm? Or you'd like to extend the software stack with your own plugin? No problem, I got it covered.
