Having to solve a lot of small hurdles in the exciting journey through the world of programming I benefited a lot from online forums. Not only did I receive a lot of help, I also could help others with the knowledge I had been allowed to gain.

One day I stumbled upon [this forum thread â€“ and offered my help.][projectstart] There it was, my first bigger project. For over two years I spent quite a few afternoons working on the project after having done my homework.

It wasn't exactly rocket science, but at the end I had written [the PC software][github] for the first [Persistence of Vision][adafruit] system [for RC helicopters][hackaday].
